# CustumDiscTTS
This is an attempt to make TTS bot that allows for users who dont have a mic or must be muted to talk via TTS. 
Since the regular tts of Discord sends the message to all users who have TTS activated regardless if they are in the call, this
bot aims to make TTS audible for just the people on the call, allowing the previously mentioned people to talk without interrupting
everybody else on the call.

It works using:
* Py-cord
* gTTS
* Mimic3

If you find this I hope it's useful to you!!!
